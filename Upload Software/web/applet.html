		  <p>Thank you for downloading Thin Upload Pro</p>
		
		  <p>Thin Upload Pro is an advanced file upload solution. It uses compression to increase the transfer speed. Images can be resized at the client side and thumbnails generated. Very large files with sizes in the hundreds of Giga bytes range can be sent over HTTP connections.
		   </p>

		   <p>The applet supports both the PUT and POST methods of HTTP. FTP support is also available. Entire folder trees can be uploaded with either protocol.
		   </p>

		   <p>These are just some of the features available in Thin Upload Pro please refer to the <a href="http://upload.thinfile.com/docs/?pro">documentation</a> for more information and usage.
